# My AI-Guided Python Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is my public logbook for learning Python from scratch. I'm using AI as my guide and teacher to create a project-based curriculum.

### The Goal
To go from zero programming knowledge to being able to build and create useful things with Python. I'm holding myself accountable by posting my progress daily and sharing all my code here.

### The Plan
- **Method:** Project-based learning.
- **Teacher:** AI will dictate my learning path and projects. (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05)
- **Accountability:** Daily commits and updates on social media.

### Follow My Progress
